Change worker spawn to spawn if: T/6 > W + 1 (float), where T is the trees that he sees and W are the allied workers that he sees.
	- Pros:
	- In case a unit sees a forest it will spawn workers instead of trees

	- Cons:
	- In a map like chess, a worker can only cut 4-5 trees, so maybe not enough workers will be spawned. This can be fixed with some conditionals.

Soldier attack logic steps:
- Initialize my dmg according to my level and my active ability
- Check for unit with highest health that can be killed
- If the final chosen unit to attack dies also without the active ability, don't use it.
- In case that there is a tie and the unit can be killed, check for attack cooldown and choose the one that can attack next turn.
- In case of tie, choose the highest damaging unit.
- In case of tie, choose the highest max health unit.
- In case of tie, choose the one with more XP.
- In case of tie, choose the closest one.
- In case of tie, random.

Soldiers should:
- Try to attack
- Try to move
- Try to attack

Workers should:
- Try to harvest (priority: small trees > oaks; high health > low health)
- Move
- Try to harvest
- Plant tree and or spawn worker (preferably in the direction they last moved)
