Soldier attack logic steps:
- Initialize my dmg according to my level and my active ability (done)
- Check for unit with highest health that can be killed (done)
- If the final chosen unit to attack dies also without the active ability, don't use it.
- In case that there is a tie and the unit can be killed, check for attack cooldown and choose the one that can attack next turn.
- In case of tie, choose the highest damaging unit.
- In case of tie, choose the highest max health unit.
- In case of tie, choose the one with more XP.
- In case of tie, choose the closest one.
- In case of tie, random.
- If it can't be killed:
	- Attack the lowest health one (done wiwhout active)
	
Soldiers others:
- If Archers can't kill anyone, then they should always use the active on the highest health target
- Knights should only dash archers or workers (only if they are not already next to one of them)
- Soldiers gravity: Known enemy location > Enemy starting position (if not currently seen and free of enemiees) > Part of the map not explored (a function should be done for this last part)

Workers should prioritize:
- Harvest priority: small trees > oaks; high health > low health)
- Spawn worker (preferably in the direction they last moved) && Plant tree (near other trees if possible)

Other:
- Improve water vs allied worked gravity ratio
- Make global function that decides the ratio between troops/workers/barracks
