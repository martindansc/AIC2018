- Improve worker spawn (done)

- Attack function
- Spawn soldiers and barracks proportionally to the enemies seen and our workers and resources

	- Towards enemy seen by units - archers keep distance
	- Towards a random enemy seen by others (done, 2 versions don't like neither of them xD)
	- If no enemies seen:
		- Towards enemy base (somewhat done)
		- Towards a random, not visible location inside the map (needs last function)
		- If map not determined, move random.
